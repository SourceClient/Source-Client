# Source Client {BETA}
## Coming soon! Maybe even July 4th???
As we head into 2022; Eternal, King Alts, and Azura's discords being terminated, and Immaculate ratting over 30 people, I state, "We are fucked."

## Pricing and Discord
The Discord {https://dsc.gg/sourceclient/} and the client will be only 10!? Wow!

## Features
Literally what any other client has:
Killaura,
Scaffold,
Fly,
Disabler,
Step,
TargetStrafe,
ESP,
and AutoEZ.
